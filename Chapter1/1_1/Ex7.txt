The precision for computing the square roots of small numbers is low because of our error 
threshold being at 0.001 which is actually quite a large error when talking about the
square roots of numbers < 1. As for the lack of preciison with computing square roots for 
large numbers, the reason the procedure fails their is because of the limitations in the 
memory capacity for scheme with large numbers. It is also that with large numbers error  
of about 0.001 can yield large differences between the outputted sqrt and the actual sqrt.
